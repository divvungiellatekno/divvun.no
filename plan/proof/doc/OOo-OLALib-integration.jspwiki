!!!OOo integration

This is a first draft of how a tighter integration with OOo could be done, which would form the basis for more advanced functionality later on.

At present, this amounts to a set of hopefully useful links to the OOo api documentation:

* [http://api.openoffice.org/docs/common/ref/com/sun/star/linguistic2/module-ix.html]

* [http://api.openoffice.org/docs/common/ref/com/sun/star/text/GenericTextDocument.html]

Regarding the user interface, [LanguageTool|http://www.languagetool.org/] could be a source for inspiration, and possibly code + cooperation.
