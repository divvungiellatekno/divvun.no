From orthography to phonology - some unresolved issues

The North Sámi orthography does not represent certain features:

#allegro shortening
#difference between long and short geminates, QIII vs QII
#difference between long and short monophthongs
#difference between long and short diphthongs
#consonants within the foot and between two consecutive feet

ALLEGRO SHORTENING
Words with long latus vowels can be allegro shortened. This means (disyllabic) words with final vowel /ii/, /aa/ and /uu/. These vowels shorten to /e/, /a/ and /o/ respectively. 

Some of this shortening is 'represented' in the orthography, specifically shortening of /ii/ and /uu/ to /e/ and /o/. When these monophthongs are preceded by diphthongs, we know the words are in allegro form, and that the diphthongs will be shorter tha usual. This is because original /e/ and /o/ always lead to diphthong simplification. /a/ is problematic, because there is also an original short /a/ which does not lead to diphthong shortening:
/ŏasta/ vs /poasta/.

Morphological tags can solve this. Here are some rules for allegro shortening:
Compounds: when modifier component is in nom.sg:boastabiila: pŏastapij:la
present tense connegatives: in oađe: in ŏađe
2sg imperative: oađe: ŏađe


GEMINATES
While long and short clusters are differentiated in orthography, long geminates are written with two letters, exactly like short geminates:

orthographic        phonological
Guossi.nom.sg        /kuos:sii/
Guossi.acc.sg        /kuossii/
guossa.nom.sg        /kuossa/

There are some rules that can help decide between QIII and QII:

- Primary lengthening: Strong grade short geminates lengthen to QIII between short monophthongs in the vowel centre and long vowels in the latus. This means the geminates that alternate with a singleton consonant in the weak grade.

- Stem class: contracted verbs are always QIII: 
besset.inf: /pes:seht/ vs besset.1pl.present: /peesseht/ - beassat
This means verbs with-e, -o or -á in the latus.

- Passive formation: o-passives are always QIII
borrot.inf: /por:roht/ vs borrot.1pl.imp: /porroht/
This is just a special case of the stem class rule.

- Present participle: Present participles are always QIII
borri.PrsPrc: /por:rii/

- Imperative: 1du and 2du are always QIII: borru: /por:ruu/ borri: /por:rii/

MONOPHTHONGS
The three main rules are:
Monophthongs are short (except á)
Monophthongs that stem from diphthongs are long before QI and QII.
Monophthongs that stem from diphthongs are short before QIII.

The first and third rule are not problematic, we have that already, since monophthongs are represented as short everywhere.

We get long monophthongs in these environments:
before latus /o/
before latus /e/
before latus+finis /ij/
before /uj/ in illative singular
(There are also some -uj adjectives with diphthong simplification, but these are all QIII, so the monophthong is short anyway.)


Original (not allegroshortened) /e/ and /o/ and /ij/ always monophthongize preceding diphthongs. /uj/ does so only in illative singular. A monophthong 
/i, o, e, u/ before /e/, /o/ and /ij/ can thus be a monophthongized diphthong. If it is, it will be long before QI and QII consonant centre. The monophthong could be a simplified diphthong or an orginal monophthong. Check out the homonyms from -at and -it verbs:

Soahpat - moai sohpe: /soohpe/
Sohpat - moai sohpe: /sohpe/
Diehtit - moai dihte: /tiihte/
dan dihte:          /tihte/
Bieđđat - moai biđđe: /piiđđe/ 
Biđđit - moai biđđe:   /piđđe/ 

There are same kind of problems with /ij/:
Biđđit - son biđii: /piđij/
Diehtit - son diđii:/diiđij/


DIPHTHONGS
The difference between short and long diphthongs is determined phonologically, so we already have rules for these:

define DiphthongShorteningIIIGr: diphthongs shorten before QIII
define DiphthongShorteningSecLng: diphthongs shorten after secondary lengthening
define DiphthongShorteningAllegro: diphthongs shorten in allegro forms

(Some modifications are needed, for example to make the first rule recognize all QIII:s, and to make the last rule not apply to demonstratives+question particle, such as 'duogo', and other similar constructions. The last rule only recognizes allegro forms with /e/ and /o/ in the latus, but not forms with /a/ in the latus).


POSITIONS
Different positions are problematic when it comes to words with consecutive stresses, in which the first syllable has a coda, such as:
vilbealli
njálfáhtta
máilbmi

In these words, the consonant centre is between the ultimate and penultimate vowels. Now there is nothing that identifies the consonant centre in that way. Phonological /l.p/ and /lə.p/ are represented in the same way orthographically, and we get transcriptions like:

vilbealli: /vilə.peæl.li/ What we want is: /vil.peæl.lii/
máilbmi: / mɑːjl.bmiː/ We want: /maa.jilə.pmiː/

The same is also true for compounds with one simplified element:
Bihkkajárgáddi: /pihː.kɑ.jɑrə.kɑːdː.ti/ We want: /pihː.kɑ.jɑr.kɑːdː.tii/

Counting syllables is therefore not good enough.
