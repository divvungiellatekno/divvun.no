Reading instructions

#This document is the beginning of reading instructions for voice talents. 

#Neutralizations in Guovdageaidnu dialect:

gŋ, kŋ and ŋ –> dnj, tnj, nj
ddj, dj ->  žž, čč      (in some speakers)
tk, tkk ->  sk, skk
tm, tmm - > sm, smm
dn ->   tn              (in some speakers)
ŧ:ŧ, ŧŧ, ŧ -> s:s, ss, s

hr:r, hr, hr -> r:r, rr, r (in some speakers)
hl:l, hl, hl -> l:l, ll, l  (in some speakers)
hm ->           m           (in some speakers)
ih:l, ihll - >  il, ill     (in some speakers)
ih:m, ihmm ->   im, imm     (in some speakers)
ih:n; ihnn ->   in, inn     (in some speakers)
vh:l, vhll ->   vl, vll     (in some speakers)

In reading, the following contrasts should be maintained:

voiceless sonorants: i.e. skuhrrat vs. skurrat, liehmu vs. liema
palatalized stops:  moddját vs. gožžat, bidjat vs. gičču
t-clusters:         gotka vs. goaski, fátmi vs. leasmi
voiced nasal clusters:  eadni vs. eatni
ŧ:                      muoŧŧá vs. guossa

(This leaves one neutralization, velar vs. coronal nasal clusters. I don't think it is realistic to expect speakers to be able pronounce the velar clusters while at the same time maintaining good reading fluency.)

#Choice of words
Some words have been chosen because they contain infrequent consonant centres. One example is 'gieđbmi - gieđmmi'. The variant used in Guovdageaidnu is 'gievdni - gievnni'. To ensure enough occurernces of 'đbm-đmm', 'gieđbmi' is used in the text, and must not be replaced by 'gievdni'. 
Another one is 'guđju'. It shoud not be read as 'gulju'. 

The texts have been adapted to Guovdageaidnu reading, so he few 'alien' things remaining, should be read as they are written.
