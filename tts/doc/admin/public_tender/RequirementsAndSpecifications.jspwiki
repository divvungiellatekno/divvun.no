!!!Specification of the product to be delivered

!!Overview
The goal of the tender part of the Divvun TTS project is to create the following product based on resources developed in cooperation between the selected tenderer and the Divvun and Giellatekno groups:

* North Saami synthetic voices for Windows, MacOS X and Linux (exact versions defined further down)
* standard installation packages

The contractor should deliver all parts including installation packages such that end users will only have one installation to do, after which the computer will be able to read text aloud in North Saami.


!!Microsoft Windows
The Divvun TTS project is asking for a bid for the making and the integration of North Saami synthetic voices and a full text-to-speech system for Microsoft Windows, based on the existing computational linguistic resources.

!Microsoft Office for MS Windows

The exact list of deliverables for MS Windows is:
#	one set of binary files to provide North Saami spelling correction using the CSAPI version 3 in MS Office 2000, MS Office XP and all MS Office versions released before October 1st, 2007, running on MS Windows 2000 (all versions), MS Windows XP (all versions) and MS Windows Vista (all versions). 
#	one set of binary files to provide North Saami hyphenation using the CHAPI version 3 in MS Office 2000, MS Office XP and all MS Office versions released before October 1st, 2007, running on MS Windows 2000 (all versions), MS Windows XP (all versions) and MS Windows Vista (all versions). 
#	one set of binary files to provide Lule Saami spelling correction using the CSAPI version 3 in MS Office 2000, MS Office XP and all MS Office versions released before October 1st, 2007, running on MS Windows 2000 (all versions), MS Windows XP (all versions) and MS Windows Vista (all versions). 
#	installation application to provide end users with a simple and automatized process of correctly installing the binary files listed above. The installation package shall be provided in the following languages: 
##	English and the following Nordic languages at no additional cost, provided they are readily available from the tenderer: Norwegian bokmål, Swedish and Finnish. 
##	North Sámi, and potentially some or all of the following Nordic languages if not readily available from the tenderer: Norwegian bokmål, Swedish and Finnish. These language versions are based on translations provided by the Divvun team. 
#	user documentation in the following languages:
##	English and the following Nordic languages as far as readily available by the tenderer: Norwegian bokmål, Swedish and Finnish. 
##	user documentation in North Sámi, and possibly in other Nordic languages if not readily available from the tenderer: Norwegian bokmål, Swedish and Finnish. These language versions are based on translations provided by the Divvun team. 

The assumption behind the first installation application and user documentation points (4.1 and 5.1, respectively) is that the tenderers have similar or identical existing products, and thus existing user documentation to be utilised. Any existing user documentation will be reviewed before being accepted.

!Microsoft Office for MacOS X

The exact list of deliverables for MacOS X is:
#	one set of binary files to provide North Saami spelling correction using the CSAPI version 3 in MS Office 2004 and all MS Office versions released before October 1st, 2007 (both PowerPC and Intel architecture versions), running on MacOS X 10.3, MacOS X 10.4, MacOS X 10.5 (PowerPC and Intel) and all other versions of MacOS X released before October 1st, 2007.

#	installation application to provide end users with a simple and automatized process of correctly installing the binary file(s) listed above. The installation package shall be provided in the following languages: 
##	English and the following Nordic languages at no additional cost, provided they are readily available from the tenderer: Norwegian bokmål, Swedish and Finnish. 
##	North Sámi, and potentially some or all of the following Nordic languages if not readily available from the tenderer: Norwegian bokmål, Swedish and Finnish. These language versions are based on translations provided by the Divvun team. 
#	user documentation in the following languages:
##	English and the following Nordic languages as far as readily available by the tenderer: Norwegian Bokmål, Swedish and Finnish. 
##	user documentation in North Sámi, and possibly in other Nordic languages if not readily available from the tenderer: Norwegian Bokmål, Swedish and Finnish. These language versions are based on translations provided by the Divvun team. 

The assumption behind the first installation application and user documentation points (4.1 and 5.1, respectively) is that the tenderers have similar or identical existing products, and thus existing user documentation to be utilised. Any existing user documentation will be reviewed before being accepted.

!!!Existing resources

The Divvun TTS project has a set of resources available:
*	trained linguists, computational linguist and software engineers
*	large lexicons with proper inflectional class tagging
*	a corpus of Saami text
*	other resources, such as test beds for linguistic testing, documentation infrastructure, etc.

* transducers for:
** morphological analysis
** word-form generation
** orthography-to-IPA transciption
* disambiguator
* syntactic parser
* dependency tree parser
* voice recordings (not yet completed
* a corpus built specifically for the recordings
* a larger corpus with several types of texts (dominated by news and bureaucratic texts, as well as the bible); the corpus for North Saami is about 15 mill. words

The tenderers should utilize these resources, and specify how they intend to do so in their application, as well as specify how the work-load will be shared between the Divvun TTS project group and the tenderer, and how the tenderer is envisaging the cooperation. It is obvious that the Divvun TTS project will conduct the linguistic testing of the final products, thus this does not need to be specified.

More detailed descriptions of some of the resources follow below.

!!Transducer resources

!!Parsing resources

!!!Speech synthesis technology

The existing TTS-oriented resources are developed in close cooperation with the speech technology resource group at the Linguistics department, Helsinki university. Based on a number of considerations, we are primarily targeting synthetic voices using a Hidden Markov Model synthesis. Other synthesis technologies can be considered, depending on price, feasability wrt the existing resources and scaleability for new languages.

!!!Preprocessor

The tenderer will have

The individual copyright holders will retain their copyrights, and a list of copyright holders will be shipped to end users as part of the products, but the copyright holders will not be able to charge for their copyright beyond the one-time payment covered by this project.
The companies are not allowed to resell, bundle or otherwise distribute the final products without prior written consent from the Saami Parliament.

!!Escrow
All source code needed to completely rebuild the products must be available through an escrow agreement, if not directly available as open source or in other forms.

!!!Evaluation of the tenders
!!Selection criteria 
The Divvun TTS project will select the economically most advantageous offer, based on the following criteria:

*	Price and total costs
*	Technical compatibility
*	Willingness to license tools to Samediggi and the project group
*	Quality, functionality and user-friendliness
*	Terms and conditions

The selection criteria are not listed according to their order of importance..

!!Further information about the selection criterias
!Price and total costs
In evaluating these selection criteria, we will consider the expected total cost over a longer time period, including maintenance cost. 

!Technical compatibility
We will evaluate the technical solution presented by the tenderers and compare it with our existing linguistic resources and language technology. A high degree of compatibility will have a positive influence on total costs. 

!Willingness to license tools to Samediggi
It is important that the tenderer states whether or not it is willing to license the tools to compile the binary lexicon for the proofing tools to Samediggi. It is the wish (but not an absolute demand) of the Samediggi to be able to deliver linguistic, non-technical updates to end-users without the involvement from the cooperating companies. 

!Quality, functionality and user-friendliness
The evaluation of this criterion will be based on the description of the program solution as presented by the tenderer. The tenderer is welcome to support the verbal description with references to, or demonstrations of similar program solutions produced by the tenderer. Under this criterion we will also evaluate the user-friendliness of the solution and the usefulness of any extra functions that might be presented by the tenderer.

!Terms and conditions
The tenderer should as far as possible conform to the terms and conditions described in this tender document, including the enclosed Standard government agreement forms regarding it-acquisitions. Any reservations or deviations must be specified and described sufficiently, allowing us to evaluate the objective cost (whether they be positive or negative). 

!!!Time frame for maintaining the tender 
Minimum time frame during which the tenderer must maintain its tender is three (3) months from the time limit for receipt of tender.
