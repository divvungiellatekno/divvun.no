This is the folder for the text-to-speech (tts) preproject.
***********************************************************

Here is an explanation of the catalogue structure

admin/  = meeting memos and other admin stuff
dev/    = your own notes, outside version control
kal/    = the Greenlandic files
sme/    = the North SÃ¡mi files
script/ = the language independent script files

Each of the language folders kal, sme contain the following folders:
generated/ = the sound files generated in Helsinki and kept here for 
             reference
taped/     = the sound files taped by the test person
text/      = the sentences to be taped, in various versions 

*.snt.txt = The orthographic version of the sentences
*.ipa.txt = The ipa version
*.ana.txt = The version analysed by the grammar tools

The input to the tts machine is not *.ipa.txt, but a sampa version
of the same file. Conversion is done by the script ipa2sampa.pl in 
the script folder.

The .ipa. and .ana. versions are at the outset generated files
(generated by the phon-kal.fst, kal.fst, etc. and respectively for
other languages), but they are then put under version control for
manual correction: adding pause marks ("|") to the .ipa. version, etc.
