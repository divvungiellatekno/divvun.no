Expanding the phonological rules:


This is a document containing notes on flaws etc in our phon-sme.xfst file.
These notes will thus be the starting point for a phase II in this project.



Positions:
==========
#Define positions, at least latus. 
Latus lengthening and high vowel lengthening should apply to latus also in words with more than two syllables.
ipmirdit should be /ip.mi:r.tih/       (today /ip.mir.dih/ )
muitalusa should be /muj.hta.lu.sa:/   (today /muj.htɑ.lu.sɑ/)

From orthography to IPA:
===================================
#Single voiced stops and affricates as voiceless in all positions.
We have this for initial position now, so we have gođii and nagođii as
/ko:.đij/ and /na.go.đij/. 
!!#s-clusters should be like h-clusters in IPA.
s+C should be ssC, s+CC should be sC, so that strong grade is ssC and weak grade is sC: baste - bastte: /pas.ste/ /pas.te/ - This is already done. BA

Monophthong length:
====================
#Simplified diphthongs are long, except before QIII. 
We should have a difference between gođđit > gođii and goahtit >gođii: /kođij/ and /ko:đij/ respectively
Differentiating between two strings gođii on the IPA side requires grammatical analysis.

QIII -rules:
=============
#QIII should be defined for both geminates and clusters.
Something like the rule StrongGrade. Then we could have vowel/diphthong rules referring to QIII. We need to differentiate between guossi.nom.sg and guossi.acc.sg. 

Primary lengthening:
====================
#With QIII-rules, this could be extended to geminates as well.

Diphthong shortening:
======================
#Shortening from initially to finally stressed diphthongs.
Occurs before strong grade QIII, and in allegro forms, i.e. from /ie/ to /ĭe/.
With QIII-rules, this could be extended to geminates as well, and it could also be long monophthong shortening.
#Make the DiphthongShorteningSecLng work. It does not seem to work now.

Allegro-rules:
==============
#Rules to prevent latus lengthening from applying to allegro-forms.
Orthographic juga can be pronounced /juka/ or /jukaa/, 2.sg.imp (allegro) or verb genitive (largo). (today /juː.gɑ/)
#Diphthong shortening should apply to allegro diphthongs. 
#Schwa-clusters and similar clusters should have a different allegro-form. 
Strong grade cluster without the schwa or without the colon:
instead of orthographic biergo: /pĭerə.ko/, we should have /pĭer.ko/. Instead of orthographic váldan: /va:l:tan/ we should have /va:ltan/.
#Secondary lengthened weak grade clusters have as their allegro form the original QII cluster. čolgga: largo /čolk:.ka:/ allegro /čolk.ka/

Compounds:
==========
#Ordinary rules should apply to the last part of the compound.
#Allegro rules should apply to the first part, in cases where the first part is allegroshortened
#Syllabification in compounds. 
joatkkaskuvla is syllabified joatk.kas.kuv.la. I am not sure that this is correct.
We have a syllabificator (from Divvun) which works better than this. We will have to look at how to put it into use.

SecondaryLengthenings
=======================
#SecondaryLengtheningNas does not work
#SecondaryLengthening/Weak grade: more consonant centers? Just added jn,jm,vn,vjn

Rule interaction:
=================
#Look at PrimaryLengthening and SecondaryLengthening and LatusLengthening. 
The rules now seem to work according to my dialect, from johka to joh:ka:. As I have read according to the more conservative dialect, this is not good. Secondary long /a/, should not trigger other lengthenings.
