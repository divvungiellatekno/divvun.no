        <note label="Nyhet!">Lule Sámi text-to-speech has been released
        25.6.2024!</note>

        <p><a href="/index.html">Divvun</a> has developed a completely new Lule
        Sámi speech synthesis, and an updated North Sámi version.</p>
        
        <p>There are three lule Sámi voices: one female voice ("Siggá"), and two
        male voices ("Nihkol" and "Ábmut"). There is one North Sámi female voice
        ("Biret").</p>

        <p>Install speech syntehsis for Lule and North Sámi on Windows using
        Divvun Manager. More information and a demo can be found on <a
        href="https://borealium.org/sv/category/voices/">Borealium.org</a>. </p>

        <p>Speech syntehsis, or text-to-speech (TTS), is a program that
        transforms text to speech. A screen reader (which must be installed
        separately) reads aloud text on the screen by using the speech
        syntehsis.</p>
