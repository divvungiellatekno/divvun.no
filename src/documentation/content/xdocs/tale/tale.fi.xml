        <note label="Nyhet!">Lule Sámi text-to-speech has been released
        25.6.2024!</note>

        <p><a href="/index.html">Divvun</a> has developed a completely new Lule Sámi
        speech synthesis, and an updated North Sámi version. Speech synthesis, or
        speech-to-text, makes it possible for the computer to convert text to natural
        speech in many apps. By8 using a screen reader all text visible on the screen
        can be read aloud. There are three lule Sámi voices: one female voice
        ("Siggá"), and two male voices ("Nihkol" and "Ábmut"). There is one
        North Sámi female voice ("Biret").
        </p>

        <p>The voices are installed using Divvun Manager. More information and
            a demo can be found on
            <a href="https://borealium.org/sv/category/voices/">Borealium.org</a>.
