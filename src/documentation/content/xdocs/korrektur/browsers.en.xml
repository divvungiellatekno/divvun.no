            <title>Internet Explorer / Edge</title>
            <p>Sorry, no support - YET. It requires an <a
            href="oswide.html">OS-wide speller</a>, which should in
            principle be possible since Windows 8. We are working
            on it, but it has turned out to be harder than anticipated. We'll
            update the page as soon as we have news.</p>

         <title>Firefox</title>
            <p>Firefox needs its own proofing tools, which are installed as
            extensions in Firefox. There are actually two sets of Firefox
            spelling plugins, one made by <a href="http://tinodidriksen.com">Tino
            Didriksen</a>, and another built using <a
            href="https://github.com/voikko/mozvoikko">Mozvoikko</a>.
            The Didriksen spellers <em>only work on
            Windows</em> (for now), whereas the MozVoikko spellers work on both
            Windows and OSX. Using MozVoikko, one can <a
            href="otherapps.html">install multiple languages</a>.</p>


          <section>
             <title>Firefox on Linux</title>
             <p>The MozVoikko speller is available on Linux, but you have to
             build it yourself. Further instructions can be found on the page
             for <a href="oswide.html">installing spellers OS wide</a>.</p>

         <title>Chrome</title>
            <p>Sorry - no support. Chrome uses Google's own spelling checker,
            which we don't have access to. And Google does not support the
            languages we are working on (please prove us wrong, Google!).</p>

            <p>Safari uses the OS-wide spelling service in OSX. See the download
            options on the page for <a href="oswide.html">OS-wide spelling checkers</a>.</p>
