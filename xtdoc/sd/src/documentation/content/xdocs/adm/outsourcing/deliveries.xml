      <title>Introduction</title>

      <p>The basic goal of the outsourcing is to create the following tools
      given the linguistic resources developed by the Divvun project team, and
      in cooperation with the team.</p>

      <table>
        <caption>Overview of outsourced items</caption>

        <tr>
          <th>Host Application</th>

          <th>Deliverables</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Adobe InDesign 2 and newer</td>

          <td><ul>
              <li>hyphenator (sme)</li>
            </ul></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Microsoft Office 2000 and newer (running on Windows 2000 and
          newer)</td>

          <td><ul>
              <li>speller (sme, smj)</li>

              <li>hyphenator (sme)</li>
            </ul></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Microsoft Office 2004 and newer (running on MacOS X 10.3 and
          newer)</td>

          <td><ul>
              <li>speller (sme, smj)</li>

              <li>hyphenator (sme)</li>
            </ul></td>

      <title>Adobe InDesign</title>

      <p>The Divvun project will outsource the integration of a sme
      hyphenator, and possibly the whole making of the hyphenator. In the
      latter case, the Divvun project will provide the language-specific
      algorithm, and of course be responsible for testing the linguistic
      correctness of the deliverable.</p>

      <note>We need to contact the most important users, and check which
      version they are using or will be using. There's no use in requiring the
      contractor to test against an older version than needed, it will only
      add costs to the project.</note>

      <title>Microsoft Office</title>

      <p>The Divvun project will outsource the making and the integration of
      the proofing tools for MS Office, based on the computational linguistic
      models developed by the project.</p>
