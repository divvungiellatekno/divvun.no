      <title>Introduction</title>

      <p>The basic goal of the outsourcing is to create the following tools
      given the linguistic resources developed by the Divvun project team, and
      in cooperation with the team.</p>

      <table>
        <caption>Overview of outsourced items</caption>

        <tr>
          <th>Host Application</th>

          <th>Deliverables</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Adobe InDesign 2 and newer, primarily for MacOS X 10.3 and
          newer, but optionally also for Windows 2000 and newer</td>

              <li>hyphenator (sme)</li>

          <td>Microsoft Office 2000 and newer (running on Windows 2000 and
          newer)</td>

          <td>Microsoft Office 2004 and newer (running on MacOS X 10.3 and
          newer)</td>

          <td><ul>
              <li>speller (sme, smj)</li>

    <section>
      <title>Adobe InDesign</title>

      <p>The Divvun project will outsource the integration of a sme
      hyphenator, and possibly the whole making of the hyphenator. In the
      latter case, the Divvun project will provide the language-specific
      algorithm, and of course be responsible for testing the linguistic
      correctness of the deliverable.</p>

      <note>We need to contact the most important users, and check which
      version they are using or will be using. There's no use in requiring the
      contractor to test against an older version than needed, it will only
      add costs to the project. The same goes for the OS version and platform
      required.</note>

      <p>The exact list of deliverables is:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>one set of binary hyphenation file(s) for hyphenation of North
        Sámi according to the hyphenation rules of North Sámi, using the
        hyphenation API found in InDesign 2/CS/CS2 and all versions thereafter
        released before October 1<sup>st</sup>, 2007.</li>

        <li>installation application to provide end users with a simple and
        automatized process of correctly installing the binary file(s)</li>

        <li>user documentation in English and Nordic languages as far as
        readily available by the provider</li>

        <li>user documentation in North Sámi, and possibly in other Nordic
        languages if not readily available from the provider, based upon
        translations provided by the Divvun team</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The assumption behind the first user documentation point is that the
      providers have similar or identical existing products, and thus existing
      user documentation to be translated. Any existing user documentation
      will be reviewed before being accepted. If no user documentation exists,
      it will have to be created from scratch.</p>

      <title>Microsoft Office</title>

      <p>The Divvun project will outsource the making and the integration of
      the proofing tools for MS Office, based on the computational linguistic
      models developed by the project.</p>

      <section>
        <title>For MS Windows</title>

        <p>The exact list of deliverables for MS Windows is:</p>

          correction using the CSAPI version 3 in MS Office 2000, MS Office XP
          and all MS Office versions released before October 1<sup>st</sup>,
          2007, running on MS Windows 2000 (all versions), MS Windows XP (all
          versions) and MS Windows Vista (all versions).</li>

          <li>one set of binary file(s) to provide North Sámi hyphenation

          versions) and MS Windows Vista (all versions).</li>

          <li>one set of binary file(s) to provide Lule Sámi spelling
          correction using the CSAPI version 3 in MS Office 2000, MS Office XP
          and all MS Office versions released before October 1<sup>st</sup>,
          2007, running on MS Windows 2000 (all versions), MS Windows XP (all
          versions) and MS Windows Vista (all versions).</li>
