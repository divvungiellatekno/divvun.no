      <title>InDesign Proofing Tools Documentation</title>
   </header>
   <body>
      <p>The Divvun tools for InDesign has earlier only supported InDesign CS3 due to lack of support for newer versions
      of InDesign from our subcontractor. But with the release of CS5.5, InDesign supports the same proofing tools as
      OpenOffice, which Divvun has supported in a Beta version for many years. This also means that we will support
      Windows users the same as we support Mac users, as the proofing tools are exactly the same.</p>
      <p>Below you will find installation instructions for both InDesign CS3 and InDesign CS5.5. CS4 and CS5 is not
      supported, and will never be supported.</p>
      <section>
         <title>InDesign CS3</title>
         <p>The InDesign CS3 proofing tools components are built on the same technology and architecture as the proofing
         tools for MS Office. There is a <a href="/doc/proof/hyph/MSOff/index.html">separate page</a> documenting how
         the hyphenation works.</p>
         <p>Proofing tools for InDesign CS3 are provided for both North, Lule and South Sámi. They work only with the
         Macintosh version of InDesign. They require InDesign CS3 - nothing newer, nothing older.</p>

            <title>Download and installation</title>
            <p>The latest version is always available here:</p>

               <title>Installation</title>
               <p>In the instructions below, the text <code>&lt;InDesignFolder&gt;</code> refers to the folder
               containing the installed InDesign application, usually <code>/Applications/Adobe InDesign
               CS3/</code>.</p>
               <ol>
                  <li>The downloaded <code>.dmg</code> file should automatically open in a new window - if not,
                  double-click the <code>.dmg</code> file.</li>
                  <li>Copy the following files to the <code>&lt;InDesignFolder&gt;/Plug-Ins/</code> folder — an alias to
                  that folder is provided, just drag and drop the plug-ins on the alias:<ul>
                        <li><code>PldHypSamiLule.InDesignPlugin</code></li>
                        <li><code>PldHypSamiNorthern.InDesignPlugin</code></li>
                        <li><code>PldSplSamiLule.InDesignPlugin</code></li>
                        <li><code>PldSplSamiNorthern.InDesignPlugin</code></li>
                     </ul></li>
                  <li>Copy the folder <code>Polderland</code> to the
                  <code>&lt;InDesignFolder&gt;/Plug-Ins/Dictionaries/</code> folder. An alias is also provided for this
                  folder, just drag and drop.</li>
               </ol>
               <p>That's it!</p>

                  with the new ones when asked. If it doesn't work, first deinstall (see the next point), then install

                  <title>Hyphenator</title>
                  <p>The known issues for the InDesign hyphenators are the same as for the MS Office hyphenators, unless
                  otherwise noted. There are a few known hyphenation issues - for an up-to-date listing, have a look at
                  the <a
                  href="http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?product=Hyphenation&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED">open

                  <title>Speller</title>
                  <p>Presently there are a few known speller issues specific to InDesign - which relate to the use of
                  the user dictionary - but none such that they are critical to regular and full use of the speller.</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>changes in UDC/UDR are not immediately reflected in the document (e.g. a word just added to the
                     AddedWords stays red underlined until either a change is made to or near it (e.g., type a space
                     after it) or the document is rechecked.</li>
                     <li>removing a word from RemovedWords list is not reflected on the screen immediately
                     (functionality is OK, but displayed list on the screen is not updated).</li>
                     <li>NonWords (words that are in the .lex but also in the RemovedWords list (on disk as UsrDicNon))
                     are not considered before the RemovedWords list is opened explicitly by user</li>
                  </ul>

         <title>InDesign CS5.5</title>
         <note>The InDesign CS5.5 support is in alpha stage at the moment. There are some issues with commpounds in the
         speller, we have no hyphenator, and there is no automatic installer. A full release is planned for April
         1.</note>
         <p>To install Divvun for InDesign CS5.5, follow these steps:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>download the <a href="http://divvun.no/static_files/smi.zip">Hunspell package</a></li>
            <li>double click the zip file</li>
            <li>follow <a
            href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2011/11/how-to-enable-more-languages-in-indesign-cs5-5.html">these
            instructions</a> with two modifications/additions:<ul>
                  <li>you do not need to add the country code, only the ISO 639 language code is enough. That is:
                  <code>se</code> for North Sámi, <code>smj</code> for Lule Sámi, and <code>sma</code> for South
                  Sámi.</li>
                  <li>make sure the files have correct owner, group and permissions. It should be
                  <code>root:admin</code>, and <code>read-only</code> for all.</li>
               </ul></li>
         </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
         <title>Usage</title>
         <p>Proofing for Sámi works exactly as for any other language. Follow the InDesign instructions for turning on
         automatic hyphenation and continuous spell checking, and select one of the languages <code>Sami:
         Northern</code>, <code>Sami: Lule</code> or <code>Sami: Sout</code> (for CS3) / <code>Northern Sámi</code>,
         <code>Lule Sámi</code> or <code>South Sámi</code> (for CS5.5) in the language list. The text will reflow, with
         hyphens automatically inserted where needed, and misspellings will be marked with a red underline.</p>
