         <p>The Divvun installer is made using NSIS, and is by default enabled for silent installations, and thus easy
         mass-deployment. You should run the installer using option <code>/S</code> to run it in silent mode:</p>
         <source>MSOfficeDivvunTools.exe /S</source>
         <warning>Presently (Divvun 2.1) there is a known bug in the installer, in which it for certain Windows
         configurations will pop up dialog boxes. These dialogs will pop up even though option /S is used, and will thus
         break the silent install. The exact conditions under which this happens is unknown, but a fix is ready and will
         be rolled out as part of Divvun 2.2 (expected soon).</warning>

         <p>The Mac installer is made using Apple's own installer tools, and should be easily integratable in a larger
         deployment scheme. See Apple's own documentation for further details.</p>
