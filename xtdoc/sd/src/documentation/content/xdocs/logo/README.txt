Logo README

The fonts used to produce the Divvun logo are:
- Skia for the text
- FreeSerif or Unicode Symbols for the check mark

The check mark is slightly turned counter-clockwise, and coloured green. The exact colour code is #1DDF00.

This is based on what was used for the CD cover and our home page logo.
