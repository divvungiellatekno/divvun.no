      <title>What is Divvun?</title>
      <p>
        Divvun is a project run by the Sámi Parliament in order to make spell
        checkers for the Sámi languages. In the first phase of the project this
        means spell checkers and hyphenation for Northern Sámi, and spell
        checkers for Lule Sámi - the background for this prioritising is found
        on these pages (in <a href="sma-background.nb.html">Norwegian</a> or in
        <a href="sma-background.se.html">Sámi</a>). The tools will work on
        Windows, Linux and Mac, with the usual office environment programs.
      </p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>
        The project was planned and thereafter started because the Sámi
        Parliament wanted to give Sámi speakers and other Sámi users the same
        writing aid tools as Norwegian speakers. This is especially important
        because many Sámi speakers never learned to write Sámi in school. The
        project is part of a larger policy to strengthen the Sámi languages, and
        to increase the use of Sámi as a written language.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is financed by the <a href="http://www.samediggi.no">Sámi
        Parliament</a>, and the <a
        href="http://www.odin.dep.no/krd/english/bn.html">Ministry of Local
        Government and Regional Development</a>, the <a
        href="http://www.odin.dep.no/ufd/english/bn.html">Ministry of Education
        and Research</a> and the <a
        href="http://www.odin.dep.no/kkd/english/bn.html">Ministry of Culture
        and Church Affairs</a>, and the final programs will be accessible for 
        all wanting to write in Sámi.
      </p>
      <p>
        We aim at making spell checkers that are geared towars Sámi as it is
        used both in Norway, Sweden and Finland. Since the project is run as a
        Norwegian project only, the final programs may have a Norwegian bias. If
        this will be the case, it is against our intentions, we want programs
        that may be used by all users, irrespective of country of origin.

      <title>Organising</title>
      <p>
        The project is run by the language department of the Sámi Parliament. It
        has its own board, with members from the Sámi Parliament, the
        Ministries, and the University of Tromsø.

        The project is based upon work done at the University of Tromsø, and
        has a close and daily cooperation with the language technology group
        there, so close that most of our infrastructure is shared (cf. the tab
        "<a href="http://giellatekno.uit.no">Samisk disamb.</a>" above).

      <p>
        At project kickoff, the detailed list of deliverable programs looked as
        follows:
      </p>
      <table>
        <caption>Overview over planned products</caption>
        <tr>
          <th>Program/OS</th>
          <th>Spell checker</th>
          <th>Hyphenation</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>MS Office/Win</td>
          <td>x</td>
          <td>x</td>       
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>x</td>       
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>x</td>
          <td>?</td>       
        </tr>
        <tr><td>OpenOffice/Mac</td>  <td>x</td>            <td>?</td>       
        </tr>
        <tr>

        <tr>

          <td>-</td>
          <td>x</td>       
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Aspell (Win/Mac/Linux)</td>
          <td>x</td>
          <td></td>       
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        This list may be adjusted during the course of the project, but there
        will probably not undergo substantial revisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project will offer early test versions (so called alpha- and
        betaversions) for interested users (betatesters). When the firest test
        version is made accessible, we will publish more information on testing
        and usage. A more detailed project plan, with important milestones for
        the different projects may be found <a
        href="timetable.en.html">here</a>, and some more details on how the work
        is being conducted may be found <a href="howmake.en.html">here</a>.
        See also the final section, containing useful links.

    <section>
      <title>The language policy of the project</title>
      <p>
        The project is multilingual, and this will be true also for our written
        documentation, cf. <a href="lang-policy.en.html">The language policy of
        the project</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project does not have its own policy for the standardisation of the
        Sámi written languages, and it will follow all decisions made by Sámi
        language bodies. When the decided norm is unclear, we will ask for a
        clarification from these bodies.
