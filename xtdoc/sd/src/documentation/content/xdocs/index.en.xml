      <title>What is Divvun?</title>
      <p>
        Divvun is a project run by the Sámi Parliament in order to make spell
        checkers for the Sámi languages. In the first phase of the project this
        means spell checkers and hyphenation for Northern Sámi, and spell
        checkers for Lule Sámi - the background for this prioritising is found
         <a href="sma-background.html">on this page</a>. The tools will work on
        Windows, Linux and Mac, with the usual office environment programs.

        At project kickoff, the detailed list of deliverable programs looked as
        follows:
      </p>
      <table>
        <caption>Overview over planned products</caption>
        <tr>
          <th>Program/OS</th>
          <th>Spell checker</th>
          <th>Hyphenation</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>MS Office/Win</td>
          <td>x</td>
          <td>x</td>       
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>MS Office/Mac</td>
          <td>x</td>
          <td>x</td>       
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>OpenOffice/Win</td>
          <td>x</td>
          <td>?</td>       
        </tr>
        <tr><td>OpenOffice/Mac</td>  <td>x</td>            <td>?</td>       
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>x</td>
          <td>?</td>       
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>-</td>
          <td>x</td>       
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Aspell (Win/Mac/Linux)</td>
          <td>x</td>
          <td></td>       
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        This list may be adjusted during the course of the project, but there
        will probably not undergo substantial revisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project will offer early test versions (so called alpha- and
        betaversions) for interested users (betatesters). When the firest test
        version is made accessible, we will publish more information on testing
        and usage. A more detailed project plan, with important milestones for
        the different projects may be found <a
        href="timetable.html">here</a>, and some more details on how the work
        is being conducted may be found <a href="howmake.html">here</a>.
